The first OggCamp was a one day unconference, held in 2009 in the glamorous city of Wolverhampton. It was an instant success, with over 
100 people queuing through the corridors of the hotel to get in. The event was run as a joint effort by two podcasts, 
<a href="http://sixgun.org/linuxoutlaws">Linux Outlaws</a> and the <a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org">Ubuntu Podcast</a>. The climax 
of the day was a live joint recording between the two podcasts which featured the now-famous raffle-cast.

The first event was such a success that people immediately demanded another one. A two-day event was held in Liverpool at the Black-E in 
2010, which had almost finished an extensive programme of renovation. Even more people came and there was an even wider range of speakers 
and subjects.

For its third year OggCamp moved down south, to the leafy surrounds of Farnham in Surrey. The massive venue was crammed with guests attending 
the two day event, many new to OggCamp. For the first time a scheduled speaker track was introduced in the main stage, with the remaining 
two tracks being run as an unconference.

OggCamp moved back up north to Liverpool in 2012 and 2013, with LJMU providing a splendid venue. Alongside the scheduled main stage were three 
unconference tracks, an open hardware jam and a coffee shop! There was a video Q&A with Stephen Fry and some people built a house in the foyer.

2014 saw OggCamp's return to the south of England with a visit to the historic city of Oxford.  The Open Hardware Jam saw participants from local 
hackspaces, while the ever-popular live podcast was revamped with an all-star Podcasters' Panel, featuring members of Linux Outlaws, The Ubuntu 
Podcast, The Dick Turpin Roadshow, and Linux Luddites.

Although started by two podcasts, OggCamp has now become something else: a genuine community event. It's the biggest free software and free culture 
event in the UK and it's still entirely free to get in.

To see how much fun people have at OggCamp, just
