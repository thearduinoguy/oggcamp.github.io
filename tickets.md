While you don't *have* to have a ticket to come to OggCamp, registering helps us know how many people to expect and provide you with a better experience, 
so please get a ticket if you're planning to come.

* Donation tickets are exactly the same as free tickets - you aren't expected to pay and wont be treated any differently if you can't/don't.  All proceeds 
help fund the event itself with any surplus going towards future events.
* We also have "Delegate Tickets" with a fixed price of £25.  Again, these are exactly the same as Free or Donation tickets.  We introduced this option 
because some attendees requested a fixed price ticket.
* If you're only ordering for yourself, select 1 Donation/Delegate *or* 1 Free ticket, not both.
* If you're ordering for more than one person and want to donate, order 1 Donation for your desired amount and the rest Free, e.g for 3 people donating £5 
each, order 1 Donation donating £15 and 2 Free. Eventbrite only allows 1 donation per order.

All attendees are required to agree and comply with the [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}/code-of-conduct).

Please note that the talk rooms are various sizes and may not be able to fit all attendees.  All sessions are first-come-first-served, so if you want to make 
sure you get a seat for a particular talk, get there early!

You can also add yourself to the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2017/oggcamp/">Lanyrd page for OggCamp 17.</a> A great way to see who else is coming, what talks 
are planned and find other information about the event. During the event, you can <a href="https://joind.in/event/oggcamp-17">leave feedback on sessions at Joind.in</a>.
